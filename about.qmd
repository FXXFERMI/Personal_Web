## Hi!

I'm Fermi, an international student currently pursuing my passion for computer science and statistics at the University of Toronto Mississauga. With a Specialist in Computer Science and a Minor in Statistics, I'm deeply engaged in my third year of university, marking my second year here in Canada.

你好，我叫费丝棋，多伦多大学大三在读学生。专业是计算机科学和统计。

My ultimate satisfaction lies in applying the knowledge I acquire to real-world scenarios, which is why I decided to study abroad.
